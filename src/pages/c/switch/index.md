title: Switch Case

# Switch Case

The switch statement is like a set of `if statements`.
It's a list of possibilities, with an action for each possibility, and an optional default action, in case nothing else evaluates to true.
We exit from the switch by `break`.
## Syntax of switch...case
```
switch (n)
â€‹{
    case constant1:
        // code to be executed if n is equal to constant1;
        break;

    case constant2:
        // code to be executed if n is equal to constant2;
        break;
        .
        .
        .
    default:
        // code to be executed if n doesn't match any constant
}
```

### Example
```
# include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    char operator;
    double firstNumber,secondNumber;

    printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): ");
    scanf("%c", &operator);

    printf("Enter two operands: ");
    scanf("%lf %lf",&firstNumber, &secondNumber);

    switch (operator) {
        case '+':
            printf("%.1lf + %.1lf = %.1lf",firstNumber, secondNumber, firstNumber+secondNumber);
            break;
        case '-':
            printf("%.1lf - %.1lf = %.1lf",firstNumber, secondNumber, firstNumber-secondNumber);
            break;
        case '*':
            printf("%.1lf * %.1lf = %.1lf",firstNumber, secondNumber, firstNumber*secondNumber);
            break;
        case '/':
            printf("%.1lf / %.1lf = %.1lf",firstNumber, secondNumber, firstNumber/firstNumber);
            break;
        // Operator is doesn't match any case constant (+, -, *, /)
        default:
            printf("Error! operator is not correct");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Output:
```
-> Enter an operator (+, -, *,): -
-> Enter two operands: 32.5
-> 12.4
-> 32.5 - 12.4 = 20.1
```
